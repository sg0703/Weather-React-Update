# Weather App! (React.js Version)

![License badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Description

For this project, I re-wrote the Weather App! using React.js. This app utilizes the OpenWeather API to get current weather conditions for any city that you search. This is the first draft, later versions will include a 5 day forecast and will store past successful searches.

## Install and Test

Download the repo, get your API key, configure the app to use your API and try it out. I have this project configured so that my API key remains hidden.

You have two options for linking your API key to your version of the project. The first option is to just put it in plain text within apis/weather.js. The second option is to create a config.js file that exports a KEY variable with the key value. If you do this and are also using GitHub, be sure to add config.js to your .gitignore file!

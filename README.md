# Weather App! (React.js Version)

![License badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Description

For this project, I re-wrote the Weather App! using React.js. This app utilizes the OpenWeather API to get current weather conditions for any city that you search along with a 7 day forecast. The app also stores your past searches for future reference. Currently not a responsive/mobile design, that is in development.
